# JISMO: Joint IDL and Scattering Modeling of Dust Sightlines/Joint Interstellar Sightline Model

**JISMO** is a dual-pipeline codebase designed for modeling dust properties in individual interstellar sightlines. It was developed and applied in the context of the [LIPS III](#applications-and-citation) study, where it was used to model ISM dust properties based on reddening, polarization, and dust emission for a sample of stars based on FORS spectra and other observations.

## Overview

JISMO combines two core components:

1. **IDL Fitting Pipeline**

   * fits optical polarization (from VLT/FORS), reddening curves, and optionally submillimeter Planck data to optimize the dust grain model parameters.
   * Iteratively determines the best-fit physical parameters by calling the Fortran simulation.

2. **Fortran90 Dust Modeling (JSM)**

   * Models polarized dust cross-sections, extinction, and emission.
   * Takes input parameters from the fitting pipeline and computes detailed outputs across wavelength grids for a three-component dust grain mixture (see [Siebenmorgen R. (2023, A&A, 670A, 115)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10146)).

The pipeline supports iterative fitting: the IDL routines call the Fortran90 JSM model repeatedly to update the dusts key parameters until convergence.

## Output Files

The Fortran90 code produces the following output files per model:

* `Kappa.out` â€“ Total extinction, absorption (sa\_\*) and scattering (ss\_\*) cross-sections
* `Kappa4fit.out` â€“ As above, but matched to observational wavelength grid
* `PolKappa.out` â€“ Polarised cross-sections (sigp\_\*); zero for dark dust
* `tau4fit.out` â€“ Modeled reddening and extinction curves
* `emis.out` â€“ Dust emission spectrum
* `emipol.out` â€“ Polarised dust emission spectrum

Fitting results and diagnostic plots are stored in `Result/` and `ResultRsv/`.

## Model Fitting

### Input Observables

* **Reddening curves** (e.g. E(B-V), A(V), A($\lambda$))
* **Optical polarization** (Q, U)
* **Planck 850 Î¼m polarization** (optional)

### Fitted Parameters

* Grain abundances for carbon, silicates, and PAHs
* Size distribution parameters ($q_{mrn}$, $r^{-}_{p}$ for aC, Si)
* Dark dust contribution

## Quick Start

To use JISMO, first compile JSM:

```bash
# Recompile the Fortran90 JSM code
make clean
make jsm
```

Create a new model folder and start fitting your specific target (e.g. HD02778) with:

```bash
# Create a new model
./scripts/create_model.py MyStar123

# Run the pipeline (IDL + Fortran)
cd models/MyStar123 
./run_jismo.sh HD027778 noscreen
```

with the optional `noscreen` flag to supress `X` display output of IDL for e.g. remotely working with JISMO.

This will:

* Copy default input templates, Q-files and the JSM binary
* Prompt you to select porosity, vacuum fraction, axis ratio, and alignment efficiency of your dust components
* Fit the model iteratively using observational data in `./Data/`

To clean/reset your model folder, type:

```bash
./scripts/clean_model.py models/MyStar123/
```

To fetch a new set of cross section files for the dust components type:

```bash
./scripts/copy_qfiles.py models/MyStar123/
```
